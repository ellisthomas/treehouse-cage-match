Requirements

Your site should have two inputs and a button

In the inputs you type in a treehouse username and then hit the button

Once the button is hit your code should

Make ajax requests to treehouse and return the profile
Example url = https://teamtreehouse.com/krissycaron.json
Use Promise.all to return the two profiles at the same time
Display the profile pictures of the two profiles
Display the profile picture for each of the two profiles
Display the total number of points for each profile
Pick the cage match winner - the person with the most points
Clearly display who the winner is
Display the winners badges
Use jquery .animate method to apply animation to the images
Your code should:

Not have any grunt errors
Use es6 syntax - let, const, fat arrows
Show an user friendly message if no data comes back from treehouse - ie you type in a username that doesn't exist (hint: use .catch on your promise.all to catch the error from treehouse)
